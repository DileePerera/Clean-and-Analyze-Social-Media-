# Clean-and-Analyze-Social-Media-

## Introduction

Social media has become a ubiquitous part of modern life, with platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook serving as essential communication channels. Social media data sets are vast and complex, making analysis a challenging task for businesses and researchers alike. In this project, we explore a simulated social media, for example Tweets, data set to understand trends in likes across different categories.

## Project Scope

The objective of this project is to analyze tweets (or other social media data) and gain insights into user engagement. We will explore the data set using visualization techniques to understand the distribution of likes across different categories. Finally, we will analyze the data to draw conclusions about the most popular categories and the overall engagement on the platform.

## Methodology

First I generated arrays for each category with random values, and then those data were transferred to the data frame. Then empty data raws and duplicate raws were removed to get more accurate outcomes. Finally, they visualize the results to get clear insights.

When we consider the categories, Family content is most popular among the users of social media. Also, Fashion and Fitness content is more attractive to the users.

The above histogram shows the distribution of likes. Many posts got likes around 2000. When we observe the above chart, the low amount of likes got content and the highest amount of likes got content are equal to each other.

The above box plot shows the distribution of likes among each category. It shows that Family content and Music content have a vast distribution of likes. But music has a low mean value which means many post has low likes.

According to the above key findings, we can say that many people like to see Family, Fashion and Fitness content. Therefore businesses can do their marketing under these concepts to get more reach. Also, if someone is willing to do a startup, it is better to start from these fields. Because these are the most popular fields among people according to this project.
